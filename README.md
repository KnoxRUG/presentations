# About

This is the official repository for
[Knoxville R Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/Knoxville-R-Users-Group/)
presentations.  You can find links to presentations at the group
website.


# Presentation Guidelines

## Format
We prefer a "binary" format, such as pdf or html, rather than a "source"
format like LaTeX or RMarkdown.  While you are free to additionally
provide the source for reproducing your slides, not everyone will
have (or want to install) the packages required for them.

If you wish to dstribute powerpoint slides, please also provide a pdf,
since not every system renders powerpoint files as you see them.


## Adding a presentation
You can add your presentation slides in one of two ways:

1. Email your slides to a KnoxRUG organizer, and s/he will add the 
materials to this repository and update the slides listing on the
website.
2. You can add them yourself!
    * Fork [this very repository](https://github.com/KnoxRUG/presentations) and add your slides in the appropriate place
    * Fork [the KnoxRUG website](https://github.com/KnoxRUG/KnoxRUG.github.io) repository on GitHub and update the [slides listing file](https://github.com/KnoxRUG/KnoxRUG.github.io/blob/master/presentations.html)
    * Submit pull requests for each of your changes.
